# Llama

Stop prompt tuning. Create your own Generative AI.

## Installation

```sh
pip install llama-llm
```

## Setup your keys

Go to [powerml.co](https://powerml.co).  Log in to get you API key and purchase credits.

Create `~/.powerml/configure_llama.yaml` and put a key in it.

```sh
production:
    key: "<YOUR-KEY-HERE>"
```

## Try an example

[Google Colab Example](https://powerml.co/tweet)

## Import Llama and initialize an LLM engine.

```python
from llama import LLM

llm = LLM(name="marketing")
```

## Define the LLM interface

Define the input and output types. Be sure to include the `Context`. This helps
the LLM understand your types in natural language.

```python
from llama import Type, Context

class AdAspects(Type):
  tone: str = Context("tone of the marketing copy")
  product_features: list = Context("product features to promote")
  audience: str = Context("target audience for the message")
  subject: str = Context("subject or topic of the message")
  goal: str = Context("goal of this marketing campaign and message")
  
class AdCopy(Type):
  h1: str = Context("google ad h1 tag")
  title: str = Context("google ad title tag")
  keywords: list = Context("keywords for the search engine")
```

## Run the LLM

### Generate ad copy from different aspects you want
```python
aspects = AdAspects(
    tone="bold and bright, but not arrogant",
    product_features=[
        'asian sauces and aromatics', 
        'home-cooked seasonings and meal packs that can be easily cooked at home'
    ],
    audience="suburban families",
    subject="delicious asian meals without going to a restaurant",
    goal="get suburban moms and dads to try buy their first omsom pack or free tasting kit"
)

ad_copy = llm(input=aspects, output_type=AdCopy)

print(f"Ad copy: {ad_copy}")
```

_Output:_
```sh
> title='Delicious Asian Meals Without Going to a Restaurant | Omsom' 
  description="Try Omsom's delicious Asian sauces, aromatics, and home-cooked seasonings and meal packs. Easily cook delicious meals at home for your family." 
  keywords=[
    'Asian sauces', 
    'Aromatics', 
    'Home-cooked seasonings', 
    'Meal packs', 
    'Delicious meals', 
    'Suburban families', 
    'Omsom'
    ]
```

### Extract ad aspects from the copy you already have

```python
ad_copy = AdCopy(
    title="Omsom | Proud, loud Asian home cooking",
    description="An Omsom starter is a pantry shortcut for a specific Asian dish, combining all the sauces, aromatics, and seasonings you need.",
    keywords=[
        "asian sauces", 
        "asian food", 
        "home-cooked asian meals", 
        "home-cooked seasonings", 
        "at home"
    ]
)

ad_aspects = llm(input=ad_copy, output_type=AdAspects)

print(f"Ad aspects: {ad_aspects}")
```

_Output:_
```sh
> tone='Exciting and proud' 
  product_features=[
    'Ready-made sauces and seasonings', 
    'Variety of Asian dishes', 
    'Easy to use'
    ] 
  audience='Home cooks looking for an easy way to make Asian dishes' 
  subject='Proud, loud Asian home cooking' 
  goal="To encourage home cooks to try out Asian dishes with the help of Omsom's ready-made sauces and seasonings."
```

## Improve the LLM with feedback

```python
llm.improve(on="keywords", to="cite specific {product_features}")

ad_copy = llm(input=aspects, output_type=AdCopy)

print(f"Ad copy after improving: {ad_copy}")
```

_Output:_
```sh
> Ad copy after improving: 
  title='Delicious Asian Meals From Omsom 🍱' 
  description="Try Omsom's delicious Asian sauces, aromatics, and home-cooked seasonings and meal packs. Easily cook delicious meals at home for your family. 🍲" 
  keywords=[
    'Asian sauces', 
    'Aromatics', 
    'Home-cooked seasonings', 
    'Meal packs', 
    'Delicious meals', 
    'Suburban families', 
    'Omsom', 
    'Emojis', 
    'Gluten-free', 
    'Vegan-friendly', 
    'Low-sodium', 
    'No-MSG'
  ]
```

## Train the LLM on your data

```python
# In the format of [[AdAspects, AdCopy], [AdAspects, AdCopy], ...]
data = get_my_marketing_data() 
 
llm.add_data(data)

ad_copy = llm(input=aspects, output_type=AdCopy)

print(f"Ad copy after adding data: {ad_copy}")
